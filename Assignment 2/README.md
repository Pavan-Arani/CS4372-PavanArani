# Tree-Based Machine Learning Models Project

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares four tree-based machine learning models for classification tasks:
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. AdaBoost Classifier
4. XGBoost Classifier

## Dataset

- Samples: 1,599 wines.  
- Features: 11 properties (acidity, alcohol, pH, etc.).
- Target: Wine quality score (0â€“10).

## Requirements

### Python Version
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Required Libraries and Installation

Install all required packages using pip:
